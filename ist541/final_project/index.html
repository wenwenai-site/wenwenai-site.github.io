	<p>Reading is very important. When children are young, we should provide them with a good reading environment, teach them how to read.</p>
	
	<p>The goal of phonics instruction is to help children learn the alphabetic principle — the idea that letters represent the sounds of spoken language — and that there is an organized, logical, and predictable relationship between written letters and spoken sounds.</p>
	
	<p>This webpage is to help you understand phonics, learn the alphabetic principle. And you can help your students to read with phonics.</p>
