		<p>Letters stand for sounds in spoken language. If you think of words and sentences as a code, then when you read, you’re breaking the code. You’re matching letters to sounds so that you can sound out words. That’s de-coding, and it’s what phonics is all about.</p>
		<p>For example, the letter t stands for the sound /t/. Your students can blend these sounds together — /t/ /ŏ/ /p/ — and read the word top. The majority of words young kids come across are decodable, from simple words like top to more challenging ones like grapes or raccoon.</p>

    <div class="SectionContent">
    <div class="SectionDescription">
		<p>Phonics is, hands-down, the best way to teach students to read words. This is well-supported by research: we know that systematic phonics instruction is better than any other approach when it comes to learning to read. Why is it so effective? Because phonics gives the students the tools to read almost every word they come across. That’s really powerful.</p>
		<p>Learning phonics will have a big payoff for your students. The more success they have using phonics to read words, the more capable and confident they will feel about reading. Your students will want to have that feeling of success again and again, so it’s great motivation to keep at it when reading gets tougher.</p>

		<p>Phonics is best taught systematically, starting with the easiest elements and working up to more challenging ones. For most kids, it begins in kindergarten and wraps up by the end of second grade.</p>
		<p>They can learn better when they get all the support they can! From their teachers, parents, even friends! Give them opportunities to explore, give them encouragement, having fun reading with them. And then they will become skilled, confident readers.</p>

    <div class="SectionDescription">
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Phoneme</strong>The smallest unit of sound in our spoken language. Pronouncing the word cat involves blending three phonemes: /k/ /ae/ /t/.</li>
			<li><strong>Grapheme</strong>
			A written letter or a group of letters representing one speech sound. Examples: b, sh, ch, igh, eigh.</li>
			<li><strong>Digraph</strong>
			Two letters that represent one speech sound (diphthong). Examples: sh, ch, th, ph.</li>
			<li><strong>Vowel digraph</strong>
			Two letters that together make one vowel sound. Examples: ai, oo, ow.</li>
			<li><strong>Diphthong</strong> A gliding monosyllabic speech sound (such as the vowel combination at the end of Saturday) that starts at or near the articulatory position for one vowel and moves to or toward the position of another.</li>
			<li><strong>Schwa</strong> 
			The vowel sound sometimes heard in an unstressed syllable and that most often sounds like /uh/ or the short /u/ sound. Example: the "a" in again or balloon. All English vowels have a schwa sound.</li>
